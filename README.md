## 1- Introduction


This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a used car. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical car sales data, enabling it to estimate the price of a car based on its features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

Accurately predicting used car prices is valuable for buyers, sellers, and dealerships to make informed decisions in a competitive market. By leveraging data-driven techniques, this project demonstrates how machine learning can help automate and improve the pricing process, bringing transparency and efficiency to the used car market.


## 2- Problem Statement & Objectives

The problem statement for this project is to predict the price of a used car based on a set of features such as years used, mileage, engine size, power, kilometers driven, and number of seats.

## 6- Data Analysis

### 6.1- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
#### ‚úÖ Check for missing values
```python
car_dataset.isnull().sum()
```
#### üßπ Drop unnecessary columns

```python
car_dataset.drop(["Unnamed: 0", "New_Price"], axis=1, inplace=True)

# üßº Remove rows with null values
car_dataset = car_dataset.dropna()
```

#### üè∑Ô∏è Extract numeric info and brand name from string columns

```python
for i in range(car_dataset.shape[0]):
    car_dataset.at[i, 'Company'] = car_dataset['Name'][i].split()[0]
    car_dataset.at[i, 'Mileage(km/kg)'] = car_dataset['Mileage'][i].split()[0]
    car_dataset.at[i, 'Engine(CC)'] = car_dataset['Engine'][i].split()[0]
    car_dataset.at[i, 'Power(bhp)'] = car_dataset['Power'][i].split()[0]

```
#### üßæ Drop original string columns after transformation

```python
car_dataset.drop(["Name", "Mileage", "Engine", "Power"], axis=1, inplace=True)
```

#### üî¢ Convert the new columns to numeric (float)
``` python
car_dataset['Mileage(km/kg)'] = car_dataset['Mileage(km/kg)'].astype(float)
car_dataset['Engine(CC)'] = car_dataset['Engine(CC)'].astype(float)
car_dataset['Power(bhp)'] = car_dataset['Power(bhp)'].astype(float)

```



### 6.2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of key features with the target variable, **Price**.

- **Categorical Features:**  
  We analyzed categories such as **Location**, **Fuel Type**, **Transmission**, **Owner Type**, and **Car Company** to see their frequency distributions and impact on car prices.

- **Visualizations:**  
  Using cat plots and heat map, we observed:
  - Cars in metropolitan locations tend to have higher prices.
  - Diesel and petrol cars dominate the dataset, with diesel cars generally priced higher.
  - Manual transmission cars are more common than automatic.
  - The majority of cars are first-owner vehicles.
  - Top companies by car count include Maruti, Hyundai, and Honda.

- **Encoding:**  
  To prepare the data for modeling:
  - One-hot encoding was applied to nominal categorical variables (Location, Fuel Type, Transmission).
  - Ordinal encoding was applied to Owner Type, reflecting the hierarchy of ownership.

This analysis helped identify important features and guided the feature engineering and modeling steps.

For the full code, detailed plots, and analysis, see the [Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook](UsedCarPricePrediction.ipynb).


### 6.3- Feature Engineering
Key transformations done to prepare data for modeling:

- Extracted car company from `Name`.
- Converted `Mileage`, `Engine`, and `Power` to numeric.
- Encoded categorical features (one-hot and ordinal).
- Dropped unused columns `Unnamed:	0`, `New_Price`.


These steps improved the model‚Äôs understanding and performance.

### 6.4- Model Training & Evaluation
Multiple regression models were trained to predict used car prices, with performance evaluated on both training and testing datasets:

- **Linear Regression:**  
  Achieved training accuracy of ~70% and testing accuracy of ~73%. It provided a good baseline model.

- **Lasso Regression:**  
  Showed lower accuracy (~57% training, ~60% testing), indicating it may have underfit the data with strong regularization.

- **Ridge Regression:**  
  Performed similarly to Linear Regression with ~70% training and ~72% testing accuracy.

- **Decision Tree Regressor:**  
  Nearly perfect accuracy on training data (~99.9%) but lower testing accuracy (~83.6%), indicating some overfitting. Cross-validation mean score was ~76%.

- **Random Forest Regressor:**  
  Delivered the best results with ~98% accuracy on training and ~91% on testing data. Cross-validation mean score was ~87%, showing good generalization.

**Conclusion:**  
Random Forest Regressor was selected as the final model due to its superior predictive accuracy and balanced performance between training and testing sets.

*Note:* Accuracy here refers to the coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) score, indicating how well the model explains variance in the target variable.

## 7- Result & Discussion
#### üîç Model Performance Summary

| Model                 | Training Accuracy (R¬≤) | Testing Accuracy (R¬≤) | Cross-Validation (Mean R¬≤) |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Linear Regression     | 0.7006                 | 0.7256                 | ‚Äî                           |
| Lasso Regression      | 0.5660                 | 0.6015                 | ‚Äî                           |
| Ridge Regression      | 0.7003                 | 0.7253                 | ‚Äî                           |
| Decision Tree Regressor       | 0.9999                 | 0.8361                 | 0.7628                      |
| Random Forest Regressor        | 0.9820                 | 0.9123                 | 0.8683                      |

#### üí¨ Discussion

- **Random Forest Regressor** delivered the **highest test accuracy** (91.2%) and strong cross-validation score (86.8%), making it the **most reliable model** for generalizing to unseen data.
- **Decision Tree Regressor** achieved nearly perfect training accuracy (~99.99%), but lower test accuracy and a cross-validation score of 76.3%, indicating **overfitting**.
- **Linear and Ridge Regression** provided consistent but moderate performance (~70‚Äì73%) with no cross-validation conducted. These models are simpler and serve as solid baselines.
- **Lasso Regression** showed the weakest performance due to strong regularization, unable to fully capture relationships in the dataset.


The high performance of **Random Forest Regressor** suggests that ensemble models can effectively learn from both **categorical** and **continuous** features in price prediction tasks.

> **Note:** Cross-validation was applied only to Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor models, as they are more prone to overfitting. Simpler models like Linear, Ridge, and Lasso were evaluated using the train-test split, which provided sufficiently stable results for comparison.


## 8- Conclusion & Recommendation


#### ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully met its core objectives:

- The **used car dataset** was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed ‚Äî handling missing values, extracting relevant features (e.g., engine, power, mileage), and converting data types ‚Äî ensuring it was suitable for machine learning models.
- Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we discovered meaningful patterns such as the positive correlation between engine size, power, and price, while factors like age and kilometers driven had a negative influence.
- Multiple machine learning models ‚Äî including **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor,** and **Random Forest Regressor** ‚Äî were developed and evaluated.
- Among all models, **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the **best performer**, achieving a testing R¬≤ score of **0.912** and strong generalization as shown by its **cross-validation score of 0.868**.
  
These outcomes demonstrate that machine learning can effectively predict used car prices when provided with relevant and well-preprocessed features.

#### üí° Recommendations

- **Random Forest Regressor** is recommended for deployment due to its superior accuracy and robustness. It balances bias and variance well and can handle both categorical and numerical features efficiently.
- For further improvement, consider tuning hyperparameters or using **Gradient Boosting** or **XGBoost** for potential gains.
- Incorporate **real-time or larger-scale data** for production models to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability.
- Deploy the model with a user-friendly interface (e.g., a web app) to allow non-technical users to input car details and get instant price predictions.
